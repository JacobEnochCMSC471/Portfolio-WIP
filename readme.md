# React Portfolio Website Project
## Motivation
I originally began this project to become more familiar with HTML, CSS, React.js and front-end development in general. I worked on a full-stack development project in college but mostly in the backend.
I also wanted to create something that could showcase both my fabrication skills and coding ability (besides GitHub).
